# v2.3.0
- Added `REPOPopupPage.closeMenuOnEscape` (defaults to `true`)
  - When `false` the menu won't close when the escape key is pressed

- Added `REPOObjectPreview`
  - A custom version of the `REPOAvatarPreview` but for GameObjects

- Added `MenuAPI.AddElementToSettingsMenu`
- Added `MenuAPI.AddElementToColorMenu`
- Fixed README having inaccurate comments

# v2.1.3
- Added `REPOScrollView.scrollSpeed` (Can be null)
  - If null, the scrolling acts as normal, interpolated between local positions
  - If non-null value, the scrolling will be at a constant rate
- Added `REPOScrollView.SetScrollPosition(float normalizedPosition)`
  - This will set the scroll view & scroll bar to a specific position
  - This value is normalized, 0 represents the top of the page while 1 represents the bottom

- Fixed `REPOScrollView` from not updating when setting the `spacing` property post-creation
- Added `REPOPopupPage.pageDimmerOpacity` (Range: 0f - 1f)
- Scroll views now update when you're not hovering over them
  - This resolved some weird issues with dynamically adding items
- `REPOScrollViewElement.OnRectTransformDimensionsChange` will now update the parent `REPOScrollView` layout
  - This should fix issues with custom TMP rich text sizes

# v2.1.1
- Fixed REPOPopupPage parameters (they were backwards)
- Fixed an issue causing custom REPOPopupPage sizes to break cached pages
- Updated REPOTextScroller to fetch a TMP component if its missing one

- Added `overrideButtonSize` to REPOButton
  - This will force a custom size rather than using the label size

# v2.1.0

- Added cached pages
  - This prevents you from having to regenerate your menu constantly
    - You can only set this via the `MenuAPI.CreateREPOPage` method

- Added 'REPOAvatarPreview'
- Pressing escape goes back one page now
